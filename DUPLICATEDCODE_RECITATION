There were two refactored methods. The first method was duplicated in the subclass as in the superclass, which was therefore deleted.
The second method duplicated the same code in the super class and called a fourth method, so the subclass was made to call super.initProcessor(), followed
by its fourth method.

The HashMap types have been removed, and replaced with Map types.
